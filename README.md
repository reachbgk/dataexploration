# Data exploration using Python

This repo contains Py scripts used to explore public data sets

#### City of Chicago Employee data
This csv dataset contains list of City of Chicago employees, their job titles, department and salaries. I use Python for data analysis and Seaborn charting library for visualization.

The Py script is used to analyze this data set and find answers to questions like :
* Number of total employees
* Number of total employees per department
* Range of salaries by department for salaried employees
* Distribution of hourly rate for hourly employees
* Job titles of 10 highest salaried employees
* Top 2 highest paid job titles in each department
